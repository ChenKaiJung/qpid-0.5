<H1>Apache Qpid C++ 0.5 Installation Notes</H1>

<p>Thank you for installing the Apache Qpid version 0.5 C++ kit.
If the requisite features were installed, you can now run a broker,
use the example programs, and design your own messaging programs while
reading the Qpid C++ API reference documentation.</p>

<H2>Running a Message Broker</H2>
<p>
In AMQP, programs that send and receive messages are clients. The agents
that route and queue messages to and from clients are brokers. In order to
use any Qpid-based messaging program there must be at least one broker
running which the client(s) can communicate with. The broker need not execute
on the same system as the client, but it must be reachable using TCP/IP.</p>

<p>The broker executable is installed in the <code>bin</code> subdirectory
of your Qpid installation directory. The broker program is
<code>qpidbroker.exe</code>. The simplest way to experiment with the
broker is to open a command prompt window, cd to the installation
directory, and execute the broker:
<pre>
cd "C:\Program Files\Apache\qpidc-0.5\bin"
qpidbroker
</pre>
A small amount of information will be displayed to let you know the broker
is running and listening for client connections.</p>
<p>To stop the broker, you can simply type <code>^C</code> in the
command prompt window where the broker is running.</p>

<p>For a full list of options for the broker, you can use the
<code>--help</code> option.</p>

<H2>Using the Example Programs</H2>

<p>The example programs are located in the <code>examples</code> subdirectory
of the Qpid installation directory. There are a number of examples, each with
its own subdirectory under <code>examples</code>. You can use the examples to
<ul>
<li>Study to learn Qpid programming techniques you may want to use</li>
<li>Build and run to observe and test Qpid features</li>
</ul>
Each example's directory contains source code and Visual Studio 2008 project
files you can use to build the examples.</p>

<H2>Reading the C++ API Reference Documentation</H2>
<p>The C++ API reference documentation is HTML and can be viewed using
your web browser. It is located in the <code>docs\api\html</code> subdirectory
of the installation directory, but there is also a shortcut to the
documentation in <i>Start > All Programs > Apache Qpid > Qpid C++ Reference
Documentation</i>. Selecting that menu item will launch the documentation's
main page in your default web browser.</p>

<H2>Complete Source Code is Available</H2>
<p>If you installed the complete source code feature (which is disabled by
default) you can explore all the source code for all of Apache Qpid. This
includes the Visual Studio 2008 project files necessary for rebuilding Qpid
should you wish to do so.</p>
